# conFIEL ID

conFIEL ID is an RSA 2048 certificates manager able to function as an XRPL wallet to issue peer-to-peer transactions.

*Note: The current version of conFIEL core relies on `Payment` transfers with `Memo` fields for debugging purposes*

### conFIEL ID
KYC-ready payments require a wallet derived from a `.cer` stamped by a CA, and generated by it's self-custodied RSA 2048 private keypair. The key is managed via a PWA called **conFIEL ID** (see https://app.confiel.id) which is able to generate the wallet based on this information. conFIEL ID uses `RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5` signatures over a `pbkdf2` unique secret string to generate a BIP39 seed phrase for our wallet, to avoid using only the RSA private key as a source of entropy.

## Development

**Install dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

**Run development server**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Loading demo credentials

conFIEL ID needs some RSA 2048 SAT-issued credentials to work. To do so, a pre-defined account has been loaded in the website to be able to kickstart the project.

Once a a credential has been loaded, the user is able to generate an XRPL wallet by deriving a signature alongside a secret pin only the end user knows. This creates an additional layer of security to ensure the wallet can only be managed by the actual owner of the certificate.

Once the wallet has been derived, we can start accepting and generating transactions, alongside a `Memo` tag with the signature of the certificate user to proof ownership of the wallet and provide identity (KYC) to the payment.
